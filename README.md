To the awesome person who visits this page, 

I’m Kadir Furkan Çaybaşı. Unity Developer over 3 years who is a Mechanical Engineer decided that working on games more fun than working on aircraft! 
I develop mobile games in hyper-casual and hybrid-casual genres. Also, I develop myself :) On the road, I learned SOLID principles, design patterns, performance optimization, asynchronous programming, and more stuff about C#. I’m looking forward to learning more and becoming a great developer.

You can check out my public resporities which I opened to show off my skills. I would be delighted to hear regarding them. Any feedback is welcomed.

Discover some games I made from https://chipmunk.games and https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Kadir+Furkan+Çaybaşı to reach me about anything (preferably with good job offers) here is my e-mail k.furkancaybasi@gmail.com 

Have a great day!
