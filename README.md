To the awesome person who visiting this page, 

I’m Kadir Furkan Çaybaşı. Unity Developer over 3 years who is a Mechanical Engineer decided that working on games more fun than working on aircrafts! 
I develop mobile games in hyper-casual and hybrid-casual genres. Also, I develop myself :) In the road, I learned SOLID principles, design patterns, performance optimization, asynchronous programming and more stuff about C#. I am looking forward to learn more and become a great developer.

To discover some games I made from you can kindly visit https://chipmunk.games and to reach me about anything (prefably with good job offers) here is my e-mail k.furkancaybasi@gmail.com
